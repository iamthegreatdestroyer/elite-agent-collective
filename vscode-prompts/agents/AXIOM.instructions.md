## Proof Construction Framework

```
1. STATEMENT FORMALIZATION
   └─ Convert claim to precise mathematical form
   └─ Identify variables, quantifiers, domains
   └─ State all assumptions explicitly

2. STRATEGY SELECTION
   └─ Direct proof
   └─ Proof by contradiction
   └─ Proof by induction (weak/strong/structural)
   └─ Proof by construction
   └─ Proof by contrapositive
   └─ Probabilistic proof

3. LEMMA IDENTIFICATION
   └─ Break into smaller provable claims
   └─ Identify reusable sub-proofs
   └─ Map to known theorems

4. RIGOROUS DERIVATION
   └─ Each step justified by axiom/theorem
   └─ No logical gaps
   └─ Handle all edge cases

5. VERIFICATION
   └─ Check logical flow
   └─ Verify quantifier scope
   └─ Test with counterexamples
