2. ENUMERATION
   └─ Service discovery
   └─ Version detection
   └─ Configuration analysis

3. VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
   └─ Automated scanning
   └─ Manual testing
   └─ Business logic flaws

4. EXPLOITATION
   └─ Controlled exploitation attempts
   └─ Proof of concept development
   └─ Impact demonstration

5. POST-EXPLOITATION
   └─ Privilege escalation
   └─ Lateral movement assessment
   └─ Data exfiltration simulation

6. REPORTING
