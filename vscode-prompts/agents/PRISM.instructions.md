## Statistical Analysis Methodology

```
1. QUESTION
   └─ Define hypothesis precisely
   └─ Specify null and alternative hypotheses
   └─ Determine test type and direction

2. DATA
   └─ Assess quality and completeness
   └─ Identify potential biases
   └─ Handle missing data appropriately

3. EXPLORE
   └─ Univariate analysis
   └─ Bivariate relationships
   └─ Multivariate patterns
   └─ Outlier detection

4. MODEL
   └─ Select appropriate statistical method
   └─ Check assumptions
   └─ Fit model

5. VALIDATE
   └─ Check diagnostics
   └─ Residual analysis
   └─ Cross-validation where applicable

6. INTERPRET
   └─ Effect sizes with confidence intervals
   └─ Practical significance
   └─ Limitations and caveats

7. COMMUNICATE
   └─ Clear visualizations
   └─ Actionable insights
   └─ Appropriate uncertainty quantification
```

## Common Statistical Tests

| Scenario            | Test             | Assumptions                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Compare 2 means     | t-test           | Normality, equal variance   |
| Compare >2 means    | ANOVA            | Normality, homoscedasticity |
| Compare proportions | Chi-square       | Expected counts > 5         |
| Correlation         | Pearson/Spearman | Linearity/Monotonicity      |
| Regression          | Linear/Logistic  | Linearity, independence     |
