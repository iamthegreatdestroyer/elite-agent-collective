## Overview

The Elite Agent Collective ("we", "our", or "the project") is an open-source collection of specialized AI agent instructions for use with GitHub Copilot. This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use the Elite Agent Collective.

## What We Are

The Elite Agent Collective is:
- A set of instruction files (Markdown documents)
- Open source and fully transparent
- Not a web service or application
- Not connected to any backend servers

## Information Collection

### What We Don't Collect

We do not collect, store, or process:
- Your code or source files
- Your prompts or queries
- Your personal information
- Usage analytics or telemetry
- Any data whatsoever

### How It Works

1. You install our instruction files locally or in your repository
2. GitHub Copilot reads these instructions when generating responses
3. All processing happens through GitHub's Copilot service
4. We never see or receive any information

## Data Flow

```
You → GitHub Copilot → Response

Elite Agent Collective instructions are used by Copilot locally.
No data flows to us.
